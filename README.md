## Introduction

VitalAI's backend is the powerful engine that drives our healthcare platform. It handles user authentication, AI integration, and efficient data management to deliver fast and reliable medical care services to patients.

## Tech Stack

Our backend is built using the following modern technologies and libraries:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Adds static typing to JavaScript for enhanced developer productivity.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): A modern database toolkit for efficient and type-safe database access.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): A powerful open-source relational database system for data storage.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A popular NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.

## API Documentation (coming soon)

The backend provides a comprehensive API for interaction with the frontend. You can find the detailed API documentation at `http://localhost:5000/docs` when the server is running.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to improve VitalAI! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or provide feedback to help us enhance our platform.
